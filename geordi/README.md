# Geordi - User Analytics Engine for Zooniverse

This is version 2 of the User Analytics Engine, the project is based upon [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

Geordi is a simple REST API with storage to capture user interaction event history and retrieve/analyse the results.

It is called Geordi after Geordi LaForge from Star Trek, whose visor allows him to see far beyond what is normally visible to humans. And also because its creator Alex B is from the North East.
