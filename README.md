# geordi - a user analytics capture engine

Created for the MICO project (WP7), an API server to capture simple user interaction event history and retrieve/analyse the results.

It is called Geordi after Geordi LaForge from Star Trek, whose visor allows him to see far beyond what is normally visible to humans. And also because its creator Alex B is from the North East.
